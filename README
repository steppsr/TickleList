Tickle List is an implementation of Todo.txt in TCL/Tk.

A command-line interface will be created in TCL that can be used as
a stand-alone product. A GUI client will be built using Tk.

The application will take advantage of TCL/Tk's platform agnostic
syntax to be cross-platform compatible. The applications should be
able to run on LINUX, Mac OS X, and Windows. A TCL interpreter is
required on the platform before the application can run.

The objective of the CLI is to mimick the Todo.sh CLI from todotxt.com.
